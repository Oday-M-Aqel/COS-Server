# Clinic Office System - Server Side  

Hi, I'm Oday Aqel! ðŸ˜Š  

This is the **backend** of the Clinic Office System, designed to power the application's core functionalities. It ensures efficient data management, secure user authentication, and seamless communication with the frontend. Built using modern technologies, the backend provides a robust and scalable foundation for clinic operations.

## Features  

### **Core Functionalities**  
1. **User Authentication**:  
   - Secure login and registration using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).  
   - Passwords encrypted with bcrypt for maximum security.  

2. **Appointment Management**:  
   - Allows scheduling, updating, and deletion of appointments.  
   - Tracks doctor availability and ensures data integrity.  

3. **Data Handling**:  
   - Stores and retrieves patient records, doctor profiles, and appointment details.  
   - Efficient queries using Mongoose for MongoDB.  

4. **API Endpoints**:  
   - RESTful APIs for interacting with the system's frontend.  
   - Supports CRUD operations for patients, doctors, and appointments.

## Technologies Used  

### **Core Stack**  
- **Node.js (Express)**: For building a fast and scalable server.  
- **MongoDB with Mongoose**: For schema-based, flexible, and efficient database management.  

### **Security**  
- **JWT**: Handles user session management securely.  
- **bcrypt**: Encrypts passwords to prevent unauthorized access.
